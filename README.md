# MoviePedia project
Recently I started learing HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I thought that it would be great experience to creat something as "Fullstack Developer".

Normally I'm programming in Python, I'm also not a great programmer in Django but I can create some 'decent' Backend server. Still I found it very annoying that I'm not able to make my own website with everything I want. This project is my first try to do that kind of thing.

## So what's this page about

I want to create a website on which you can enter a movie title and search all the information you need about this movie (ie. director, budget, similar movies, actors, overwiev etc.). I'm planning to use different API's to achieve this goal.

## Why Django?

Because I want to have the opportunity to work with various movie API's. I thought Python is one of the best ways to deal with it.

## Why I'm not using Rest Framework etc...

This is small project. I want to do it using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm not using any other frameworks because I can't yet, also I think there's no need to do so in this project.

## How to turn this on?

You'll have to comment import config line in settings in project files. After that you can just use `python3 manage.py runserver`
